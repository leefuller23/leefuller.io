      <description>Rachel wrote a quiz for her family. It has 50 questions, split into 10 subjects: General Knowledge; Logos; Film and TV; Food and Drink; Country Shapes; Science and Nature; Childrenâ€™s TV; Sport; Music and &amp;lsquo;2020&amp;rsquo;.
To make it accessible and easy to interpret it is built as a slideshow using LiberOffice Impress. The first 50 slides present the questions and the remaining 50 present the question followed by the answer.</description>

      <description>Archive.org last crawled my old site on December 27 2018. I was tired of maintaining a basic personal site using WordPress since Gutenberg came along.
After nearly 2 years of downtime, here it is. This time built with Hugo.</description>
