## About

QTflix is a self-hosted VoD service. All direct family & direct/indirect friends welcome to request accounts. Public access is not an option.

It is powered by [Emby Media Server](https://emby.media/) which anyone can setup and install.

Currently there is ongoing service disruption caused by our main broadband connection being a shitty Three Mobile LTE connection with a flappy ip4 address.

There is also currently a 1Mbps bitrate limit per stream and 1 stream max per account. I hope this will improve over time.
