I am about 5 years late but it's time to learn and commit to DevOps. 

My personal projects are now complex and sprawling and people trust my storage + comptue to store Notes, Passwords, Photos + Documents.

## Current state

Syncthing is already Dockerised. 

QTflix runs on bare metal.

GitLab runs on bare metal.

Mail/Webmail and HTTP server are Linux VMs at Digital Ocean.

I have 1 x 8 year server, an 8 year old gen 6 proliant dual Xeon w/ 74GB of RAM.

## Aspirational future state
