## Introduction

I am pleased to launch my first publically accessible project.

[leefuller.io/element](https://leefuller.io/element)

This is a hosted instance of the Element Matrix client. It can be used to sign-in to any Matrix server and register accounts. 

It is currently running version 1.8.2. I will create a new post each time I deploy a new release.
