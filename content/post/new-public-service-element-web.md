## Introduction

I am pleased to launch my first publically accessible project.

[leefuller.io/element](https://leefuller.io/element)

This is a hosted instance of the Element Matrix client. It can be used to sign-in to any Matrix server and register accounts. 

## Why use it? 

It is hosted directly on CloudFlare pages (along with the rest of my site) - so it is reliable and fast.

It has the 'Labs' flag enabled in config, so you can toggle the experimental features not enabled in the 'production' version of Element.

It has the Piwik/Matamo tracking disabled.
