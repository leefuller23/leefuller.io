Rachel wrote a quiz for her family. It has 50 questions, split into 10 subjects: General Knowledge; Logos; Film and TV; Food and Drink; Country Shapes; Science and Nature; Childrenâ€™s TV; Sport; Music and '2020'.

To make it accessible and easy to interpret it is built as a slideshow using LiberOffice Impress. The first 50 slides present the questions and the remaining 50 present the question followed by the answer.
