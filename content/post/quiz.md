Rachel wrote a quiz for her family. It has 50 questions, split into 10 subjects: General Knowledge; Logos; Film and TV; Food and Drink; Country Shapes; Science and Nature; Childrenâ€™s TV; Sport; Music and '2020'.

To make it accessible and easy to interpret it is built as a slideshow using LibreOffice Impress. The first 50 slides present the questions and the remaining 50 present the question followed by the answer.

Download it as [LibreOffice Impress (.odp)](/asset/quiz/quiz.odp) or [Microsoft Powerpoint (.pptx)](/asset/quiz/quiz.pptx)

```
Edited 2021-03-30 - set links to slideshow as relative.
