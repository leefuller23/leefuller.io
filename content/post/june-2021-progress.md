I have made some decent progress. 

10 VMs have been condensed to a single, bare metal Fedora 34 container host running podman.
QTflix/Emby and QTsync/Syncthing now run in containers.
frontend-proxy/swag is up and running


Things left to do:

Fix DDNS
launch missing services (Searx, Nextcloud etc)
